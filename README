Atify
--------

The purpose of Atify, is to automatically link twitter names on a page to their twitter.com profile. For example, the script will pick up @jarques(m,d) and replace it with a link. That way I don't have to link it myself inside the HTML.

Why do this?
No real reason, just an easier way to link to say, @meltingice(m,d) and other twitter names on a page.

Hashtags anyone?
By adding a hashtag: true parameter when enabling Atify, it will also link hashtags to twitter search, such as #atify or even #beatcancer.

How do I use this?

Using Atify is extremely simple, you'll need to download and add jQuery and Atify to your page:

<script src="jquery-1.3.2.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="atify.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>

Next, all you need to do now is call the Atify method on any given element. For the examples above you can do:

$("#content").atify();
$("#hash_example").atify({hashtag: true});

To add Mention and Direct Message links, add the following parameter:

$("#content").atify({extras: true});
